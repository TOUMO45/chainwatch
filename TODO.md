# Deferred (documented in LIMITATIONS.md, not yet fixed)

- [ ] 3a-L2 — widen Rule 3a trigger from "constraint removed" to "caller set
      widened." Needs fixture: onlyOwner → require(msg.sender == mutablePublicVar).
      Real regression shape, currently invisible.
- [ ] X-L1 — implement verdict.py three-state model (DISCARDED/CANDIDATE/CONFIRMED).
      Convert 3a.1 and 2.10 from silent discard to CANDIDATE.
- [ ] 3x-L1 — segment-based test/mock path matching (currently substring).
      `latest/`, `contest/`, `greatest/`, `protests/` are all silently skipped
      today. Match a directory named exactly test/tests/mock/mocks/script, or a
      filename `*.t.sol` / `*Mock*` / `*Harness*`. Silent FN across 3a/3b/3c.
- [ ] 3x-L3 — detect ERC-7201 init machinery structurally: a modifier reading a
      constant namespace slot and writing through an assembly pointer, so
      Signal A (defines_init_machinery) works on OZ 5. Today Rules 3b and 3c
      CANNOT FIRE AT ALL on any OZ 5.x project — proven with synthetic
      regressions matching P3b-01/P3b-02 and P3c-01. This is the unlock for
      full OZ 5 support (3b + 3c), and pairs with the deferred 3c-v2 slot
      comparator. Highest-value deferred item.
- [ ] 3x-L2 — pre-screen must check OZ import paths, not just storage style.
      Sequential storage does not imply OZ 4.x; Monetrix uses OZ 5 paths
      (utils/ not security/) with sequential storage. Cost this time: 4 of 20
      files unmeasured, including MonetrixVault.
